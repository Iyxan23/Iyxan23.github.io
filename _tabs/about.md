Hi, I'm a young 14 y.o. code hobbyist that likes to play around with computery. I started playing with codes at 3rd grade elementary school (around 8 years old) with plain HTML/CSS and Sketchware. Now I've quite mastered a few skills such as [Python](https://python.org), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29)/[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), [Android Framework](https://developer.android.com), Linux (i use [arch](https://archlinux.org) btw), [Git](https://git-scm.org), and a little webdev. I started playing with Android Sketchware at 2016, [Python](https://python.org) at 2018, [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) at 2018, [Android framework](https://developer.android.com) at 2020, Linux around 2020, [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) at 2021. Currently learning the [rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org)

I'm currently picking up some interest in writing, so I often post some blogs on this website :p
