Hi everyone, as you can see from the post title, we've open-sourced the new OpenBlocks! yay!

Alright, so, I've been talking about re-naming the new openblocks into something else so it wont collide with an already-existing minecraft mod named "OpenBlocks", so yeah, it got renamed into something else which will beeeee...... Blokkok!

Yeah, the new name will be "Blokkok" which is awesome!

> A little secret about the name: the word "Blokkok" came from the translation of "Blocks" into hungarian

alright, since it's now open source, you can see the sources on to our [new shiny github organization](https://github.com/Blokkok)

Also, please do note that this is **NOT A RELEASE**, it's just open-sourcing ok. I'm sorry but there are stuff to do and I just can't wait so that people can take a peek at the source and play around with it :)

Anyway, I'm afraid that's all I got for you today, I don't have a lot to say honestly. Oh yeah, I don't post a lot of blogs these days, that's probably because of school + that I'm working on blokkok and on tyron's new [CodeAssist](https://github.com/tyron12233/CodeAssist) (I like his editor so much, might make these into modules so it can be used in blokkok, idk). I think the next blog will be me trying to create annotation communications. If you like spoilers you can see the codebase I'm working [here](https://github.com/Blokkok/blokkok-modsys), so yeah. I hope you people had a nice day and see you later in a few weeks.
