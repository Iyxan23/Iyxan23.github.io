hi to the people that actually read my blogs for some reason, I recently moved the hoster of this website from my VPS into github pages instead since I never really used my VPS and its basically a waste of money seeing that github offers a free static page hosting service (that is called [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)).

Alright then, cool, this website is up again, if you saw the cloudflare error thingy, at that point I was being lazy. It's not like the setup is hard, this isn't hard at all lmao. It simply is just generating a repo, pointing my domain to github, turning on github pages, re-upload assets from my old VPS and its all done. Why did it took something like 10 days? I was being lazy lmaooooo

alright seeya in 50 years on my next blog post
