Hello, I've just made an open-source tool named `Asperge`. It's a tool where you can extract sketchware projects, decrypt sketchware-encrypted files, and most importantly, generating code out of a sketchware project. Yeah, this tool can generate java and xml codes of a sketchware project! And, another most importantly, you can run it on your PC, since it's written in Kotlin, you'll be able to run it on the jvm hassle-free.

Also, note that the project is still work-in-progress, you might see some unimplemented features here and there (components, more opcodes, more xml attributes etc).
